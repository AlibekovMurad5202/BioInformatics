## String Spelled by a Genome Path Problem

> __CODE CHALLENGE__: Solve the String Spelled by a Genome Path Problem.
>
> __Input__: A sequence of _k_-mers _Pattern_1_, … ,_Pattern_n_ such that the last _k_-1 symbols of _Pattern_i_ are equal to the first _k_-1 symbols of _Pattern_i+1_ for 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_-1.  
> __Output__: A string _Text_ of length _k+n-1_ such that the _i_-th _k_-mer in _Text_ is equal to _Pattern_i_  (for 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_).
