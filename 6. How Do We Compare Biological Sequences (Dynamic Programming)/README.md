## Change Problem

> __CODE CHALLENGE__: Solve the Change Problem.
>
> __Input__: An integer _money_ and an array _Coins_ = (_coin_1_, ..., _coin_d_).  
> __Output__: The minimum number of coins with denominations _Coins_ that changes _money_.

## Manhattan Tourist Problem

> __CODE CHALLENGE__: Find the length of a longest path in the Manhattan Tourist Problem.
>
> __Input__: Integers _n_ and _m_, followed by an _n_ × (_m_ + 1) matrix _Down_ and an (_n_ + 1) × _m_ matrix _Right_. The two matrices are separated by the - symbol.  
> __Output__: The length of a longest path from source (0, 0) to sink (_n_, _m_) in the _n_ × _m_ rectangular grid whose edges are defined by the matrices _Down_ and _Right_.

## Longest Common Subsequence Problem

> __CODE CHALLENGE__: Use __OUTPUTLCS__ to solve the Longest Common Subsequence Problem.
>
> __Input__: Two strings _s_ and _t_.  
> __Output__: A longest common subsequence of _s_ and _t_.
